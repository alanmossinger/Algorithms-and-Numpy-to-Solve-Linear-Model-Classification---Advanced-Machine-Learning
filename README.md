# Mathematics-to-solve-Linear-Model-Classification and Optimization---Machine-Learning

Machine learning is a powerful tool that allows computers to learn from data and make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed. 
One of the fundamental concepts in machine learning is the linear model classifier, a simple yet effective algorithm for classification tasks.

In this introduction, we will delve into the world of machine learning, focusing on the linear model classifier and its optimization using stochastic 
gradient descent and modification. We will be using only numpy, a powerful library for numerical computation in Python, and mathematics, the language of the universe.

The linear model classifier is a binary classification model that makes its predictions based on a linear function of the input features. Despite its simplicity, 
it can be surprisingly effective and serves as the foundation for many more complex machine learning algorithms.

However, to ensure that our linear model classifier performs well, we need to optimize it. This is where stochastic gradient descent comes into play. Stochastic gradient 
descent is an iterative method for optimizing an objective function with suitable smoothness properties. It’s an approximation of gradient descent, a first-order optimization 
algorithm, but with a significant advantage - it uses only a single sample, or a “mini-batch” of samples, to perform each update, which makes it much faster and capable of handling very large datasets.

In addition to stochastic gradient descent, we will also explore modifications to further improve the performance of our linear model classifier. These modifications could 
include regularization techniques to prevent overfitting, different loss functions to better suit our specific problem, or advanced optimization strategies.

By the end of this exploration, you will have a solid understanding of the linear model classifier and how to optimize it using stochastic gradient descent and modification, 
all implemented with numpy and grounded in mathematical principles. This knowledge will serve as a strong foundation for your further studies in machine learning. 

Let' also explore e optimization models and see the evolution of the classification results by plotting.
1. Mini-batch Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD): This is a variation of the gradient descent algorithm that splits the training dataset into small batches. These batches are used to calculate model error and update model coefficients. Implementations may choose to sum the gradient over the mini-batch which further reduces the variance of the gradient. It’s a compromise between full-batch iteration and SGD. A mini-batch is typically between 10 and 1,000 examples, chosen at random2.

2. SGD with Momentum: This optimization technique minimizes the impact of noises in convergence to the optimal weights. It helps to reduce the convergence time. Adding momentum in SGD overcomes the major shortcomings of SGD over Batch Gradient Descent without losing its advantage. The key idea behind SGD with momentum is to build up velocity for each parameter in the same direction as the previous gradients. This can help the optimizer to overcome local minima and saddle points.

3. RMSprop (Root Mean Square Propagation): This is an adaptive learning rate optimization algorithm designed to address some of the issues encountered with the stochastic gradient descent (SGD) method in training deep neural networks5. RMSProp addresses the issue of a global learning rate by maintaining a moving average of the squares of gradients for each weight and dividing the learning rate by this average. This ensures that the learning rate is adapted for each weight in the model, allowing for more nuanced updates.

Each of these optimization techniques has its own strengths and is suited to different types of problems. The choice of optimization technique can significantly impact the performance of a machine learning model.
